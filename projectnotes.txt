UI
Simple overall theme with the wall at the center of most pages
1. Home Page: shows pints from all users.
2. Dashboard: Matches home page  with different options in nav.
3. View my wall: Shows only my pints.
4. View other user wall: show only pints by that user. Two parts: A scrolling
bar on the side with all users, and a react div displaying the current selected
users wall. Current selected user should show their username.

Functionality/Scripting
1. Passport.js will allow users to login with twitter;
2. Use React with proper routing.
3. Clean express routing.

Workflow:
1. Create authentication with twitter.
2. Create pin appearance
3. Create Main wall
4. Create user/own walls.
